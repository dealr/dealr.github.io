You can't hold them in your sweaty palms all day, and if you put them in your pockets you'll end up handing out someone else's card. You could use a business card holder and show everyone how complicated you can make simple tasks. Or, use Dealr, and retrieve each card in the blink of an eye. \r\n\r\n### Support us on Kickstarter\r\n\r\n### Our Team\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/uxKo2fT.png)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
